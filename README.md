# Minesweeper written in Elm
My first project using this fascinating functional language, Elm
[Click here for demo](https://jscriptcoder.github.io/minesweeper-elm/)

It all started 6 month ago with Redux. After discovering this great architecture, I began experimenting with it:

1. [tictactoe-redux](https://github.com/jscriptcoder/tictactoe-redux)
2. [stressing-redux](https://github.com/jscriptcoder/stressing-redux)
3. [redux-worker](https://github.com/jscriptcoder/redux-worker)

I got more and more into functional and reactive programing. Redux and Elm have many things in common: pure functions, immutability, state managment... but the best is the arquitecture behind: [The Elm architecture](https://guide.elm-lang.org/architecture/). After reading lots of documentation, watching tons of videos and attending a [two days workshop on Elm](https://frontendmasters.com/workshops/elm/), I decided to implement this game using Elm.

**Note:** Styles are inspired by [this Minesweeper in codepen](https://codepen.io/joelbyrd/pen/hdHKF), with some adaptions and new features
