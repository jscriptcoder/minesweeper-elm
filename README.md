# Minesweeper written in Elm
My first project using this fascinating functional language, Elm.

[Click here for demo](https://jscriptcoder.github.io/minesweeper-elm/)

It all started 6 months ago (by the time I wrote this) with Redux. After discovering this great architecture, I began experimenting with it:

1. [tictactoe-redux](https://github.com/jscriptcoder/tictactoe-redux)
2. [stressing-redux](https://github.com/jscriptcoder/stressing-redux)
3. [redux-worker](https://github.com/jscriptcoder/redux-worker)

I got more and more into functional and reactive programing. Redux and Elm have many things in common: pure functions, immutability, state managment... but the best is the arquitecture behind: [The Elm architecture](https://guide.elm-lang.org/architecture/). After reading lots of documentation, watching tons of videos and attending a [two days workshop on Elm](https://frontendmasters.com/workshops/elm/), I decided use this game as my starting point to deep more in the language and its architecture.

## Download source
Open a terminal or command line and run following commands:
```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/jscriptcoder/minesweeper-elm.git
$ cd minesweeper-elm
```

## Install Elm and packages
```shell
$ npm install -g elm
$ elm-package install
```

## Installing dependencies and running
```shell
$ npm install
$ npm run start
```

Give this language and its architecture a try, and I promise you will love it :-)

**Note:** Styles are inspired by [this Minesweeper in codepen](https://codepen.io/joelbyrd/pen/hdHKF), with some adaptions and new features
